For HW3_Assignment1_Manushi,

The 6 probability distributions are:
Normal
Poisson
Binomial
Chi-squared
Gamma
Laplace

I have generated a plot of sample mean against sample size for each distribution separately, as opposed to looping it together.

There are two global variables defined in the code:
populationMean = 10
sd = 1

At the end is the normal distribution of sample means as calculated above.
