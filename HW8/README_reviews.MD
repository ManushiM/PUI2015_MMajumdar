Review for the plot of am7084

![alt tag](https://github.com/ManushiM/PUI2015_MMajumdar/blob/master/HW8/alec_visualization.png)

CLARITY: The ranked distribution of quantity of budgets is expressed clearly.
ESTHETIC: The variation in quantities of the budgets of each department is graphically very clear, but the color scheme is not appropriate for categorical data.
HONESTY: The data is not represented entirely, because of the missing values along the Y axis.
SUGGESTIONS: A good plot, with a couple of changes needed. Values are required along the Y axis, and color scheme needs to be changed.

Review for the plot of amp914

CLARITY: The purpose and intent of the plot is clear, but the title of the entire plot does not fit the smaller two visualizations in the image, even though they have their own titles.
ESTHETIC: The color scheme chosen is good, especially the color contrast in the stacked bars. The choice of varied colors, and intent for the 4 hour time windows (why specifically 4) is not too clear though.
HONESTY: The plot conveys the data and the results with ease and honesty.
SUGGESTIONS: Maybe split each sub plot separately, and probabaly even work on the respresentation of the colored time slots, so as to not make it confusing at first. Also, ensure that labels and text do not overlap.


Review for the plot of mu529

CLARITY: The plot clearly represents the study performend in a clear and simple manner.
ESTHETIC: The color scheme chosen is good, but a scatter plot does not seem the most intuitive choice in representation of data like this, and thus even influences the inferences that are to be drawn from this.
HONESTY: The point that this plot is trying to make does not get established too seriously, but honestly, a simple and effective plot.
SUGGESTIONS: Maybe just check if there is a better visualization to plot data like this. Otherwise, a good plot.
