CLARITY: The ranked distribution of quantity of budgets is expressed clearly.
ESTHETIC: The variation in quantities of the budgets of each department is graphically very clear, but the color scheme is not appropriate for categorical data.
HONESTY: The data is not represented entirely, because of the missing values along the Y axis.
SUGGESTIONS: A good plot, with a couple of changes needed. Values are required along the Y axis, and color scheme needs to be changed.
