# PUI2015_dkhryashchev
# Lab1-assignment2

First, I created .bashrc file in my home directory and started editing it. I created the alias for the command cd and included the address to my directory. I named the alias PUI2015. So I can switch my current directory to PUI2015, simply writing PUI2015.

Then I created environmental variable $PUI2015 and assigned the path to the PUI2015 directory to it. So I can use the complete address, simply using $PUI2015 string.

Then I applied the alias in the command line. First, I changed my current directory from PUI2015 to /c. Then I printed out my current directory with pwd. Then I used my alias PUI2015 to switch the directory to PUI2015. And then I printed out my current directory with pwd. The alias returned me to the PUI2015 directory.
